# This reduces GTFSpreprocessing executes the first steps of the public-transport-analysis tool
# The output of the run(outputPath) function is a csv file containing the hexagonal zones within the bounding box
# defined by the extent of the stops given in the gtfs file.
#
# The GTFS file is read and put into the mongodb database
# Stops are analysed and the bounding box is calculated
# The hexagonal grid is calculated
#
# Required Data and Preparation:
# -mongoDB server has to be set up and the address needs to be provided
# -GTFS file (.zip) of the respected area needs to be provided
#  -->a date for has to be chosen within the valid days of the GTFS file
# -Shapefile (.shp) including population data for study area (e.g. spacial grid)
#  -->name of the filed in shapefile holding the pop data
#
